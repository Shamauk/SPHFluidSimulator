# Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics for Fluid Dynamics Simulation in 2D with Multiple Discretization Implementations

## Key Words

- Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
- Fluid Dynamics
- Two Dimensional
- Discretization

## Requirements

- c++11
- included modules (see zip)

## Note

- Is designed in a 2D environment so it can run in real time.

## Issues Encountered

- Wanted to have freetype but could not get it to work on M1 (so I halted development)
